# Description #

Giver is a simple file sharing desktop application. Other people running Giver on your network are automatically discovered and you can send files to them by simply dragging the files to their photo or icon shown in Giver. There is no knowledge or set up needed beyond what the person looks like or their name to use Giver.

# Origin #

Giver was started as a part of the original [Novell Hackweek](http://idea.opensuse.org/content/) in June 2007.  Engineers at Novell were given one week to work on whatever project they wanted.  At the end of the week, their work would be judged to win in specific categories.  Giver was awarded the "Best Desktop Project" award and the engineers working on Giver were all given five more days of free work time to put into giver.

At the end of the week a series of videos were made of the various projects, [here](http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=3768442676796881783&hl=en) is the Giver video.  You can also visit the original Giver [Hack Week Page](http://idea.opensuse.org/content/ideas/easy-file-sharing).
